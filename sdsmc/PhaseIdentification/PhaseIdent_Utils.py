def ConvertToPerUnit_Voltage(timeseries):
    ''' This function takes a voltage timeseries and converts it into a per
            unit representation.  This function looks at each customer's 
            timeseries individual mean, rounds the mean of the measurements and 
            compares that to a list of known base voltages.  Voltage levels may
            need to be added to that list as more voltages levels are used.  
            This allows for the case where some customers run at 240V and some
            run at 120V in the same dataset. The function will print a warning 
            if some customers have all NaN values, but it will complete 
            successfully in that case with that customer having all NaN values
            in the per-unit timeseries as well.  Supported base voltages are

    ''' This function takes a array of timeseries with high and low thresholds
        and any values outside of those thresholds become NaN.  The timeseries
        values MUST be in per-unit if you use the default thresholds.
        
        Parameters
        ---------
            timeseries: ndarray of float (measurements,customers) - the 
                timeseries to filter
            highValue: float - the upper threshold.  The default is 1.1, 
                which gives a 10% variation off of the norm.  This default 
                works well for being conservative on throwing out values 
                 for voltage because within 5% is acceptable per standards, so
                 this is double the acceptable range
            lowValue: float - the lower threshold.  The default is 0.8, 
                         
        Returns
        -------
            filteredTimeseries: ndarray of float (measurements,customers) 
                the filtered timeseries.  Any values outside of the thresholds
                replaced with NaN
            nanCount: int - the total number of values filtered
            nanCountPerCust: list of int - the number of values filtered per
                customer
